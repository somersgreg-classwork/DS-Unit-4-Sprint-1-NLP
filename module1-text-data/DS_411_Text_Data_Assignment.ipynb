Try cleaning the data as much as possible. Try the following techniques: \n","- Lemmatization\n","- Custom stopword removal\n","\n","Keep in mind the attributes of good tokens. Once you have a solid baseline, layer in the star rating in your visualization(s). Key part of this assignment - produce a write-up of the attributes of the best and worst coffee shops. Based on your analysis, what makes the best the best and the worst the worst. Use graphs and numbesr from your analysis to support your conclusions.

I\\'d come here again to socialize (when I\\'m less busy with schoolwork) but really only for the Matcha Latte & the classy atmosphere. If you haven\\'t had lunch/ dinner, don\\'t come here to fill your tummy up :\"o Matcha latte, Chicken & Waffle, Nutella Waffle, and Hot milk tea Matcha latte, Chicken & Waffle, Nutella Waffle, and Hot milk tea '"]},"execution_count":29,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df['full_review_text'][10]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":30,"metadata":{"id":"YXgZXLPEszyr"},"outputs":[],"source":["# this will take longer to run than a regex method because Spacy is doing a fair amount\n","# of extra stuff under the hood in creating the token attributes and everything.\n","\n","def spacy_tokenizer(text):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Use the pre-trained model from Space to tokenize our text into lemmas \n","    \n","    Notes\n","    -----\n","    Rememeber that the pre-trained spaCy model has a lot of built in flags for what kind of token each token is\n","    so we can use that functionality to create filters for stop words, white spaces, punctuation, and so on!\n","    \n","    See list of flags here: https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes\n","    \n","    Parameter\n","    ---------\n","    text: string\n","        Full text article/document that needs to be tokenized \n","    \"\"\"\n","    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\\s]', '', text)\n","    text = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text)\n","    text = text.replace('checkin', '')\n","    text = text.replace('\\b\\w\\b', '')\n","    text = text.strip()\n","    tokens = []\n","    for token in nlp(text):\n","        # if statement will filter out stopwords, punctuation, and whitespace\n","        # COMPLETE THE CODE HERE\n","        if (token.is_stop == False) & (token.is_punct == False) & (token.pos_ != 'PRON'):\n","            # Now lemmatize!\n","            tokens.append(token.text)\n","    \n","    return tokens"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":40,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def spacy_tokens(text):\n","  text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\\s]', '', text)\n","  text = text.replace('checkin', '')\n","  text = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text)\n","  text = text.strip()\n","  tokens = []\n","  for token in nlp(text):\n","    if (token.is_stop == False) & (token.is_punct ==  False):\n","      tokens.append(token.text.lower())\n","  return tokens"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["C:\\Users\\somer\\miniconda3\\envs\\DeepLearning\\lib\\site-packages\\spacy\\pipeline\\lemmatizer.py:211: UserWarning: [W108] The rule-based lemmatizer did not find POS annotation for one or more tokens.
