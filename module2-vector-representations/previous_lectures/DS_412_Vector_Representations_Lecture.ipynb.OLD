We need to transform that text into something we/machines can more readily analyze. Yesterday, we did simple counts of counts to summarize the content of Amazon reviews. Today, we'll extend those concepts to talk about vector representations such as Bag of Words (BoW) and word embedding models. We'll use those representations for search, visualization, and prepare for our classification day tomorrow. \n","\n","Processing text data to prepare it for machine learning models often means translating the information from documents into a numerical format. Bag-of-Words approaches (sometimes referred to as Frequency-Based word embeddings) accomplish this by \"vectorizing\" tokenized documents. This is done by representing each document as a row in a DataFrame and creating a column for each unique word in the corpora (group of documents). The presence or lack of a given word in a document is then represented either as a raw count of how many times a given word appears in a document (CountVectorizer) or as that word's TF-IDF score (TfidfVectorizer).\n","\n","On the python side, we will be focusing on `sklearn` and `spacy` today.  \n","\n","## Case Study\n","\n","We're going to pretend we're on the datascience team at the BBC.

But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax\\'s accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic\\'s government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\\n\\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\\n\\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush\\'s victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn\\'t lead it.\"\\n\\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\\n\\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don\\'t think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what\\'s acceptable for public consumption and what isn\\'t, that\\'s gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\\n\\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\\n\\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google\\'s Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are

This also means that with bag-of-words approaches often the only tools that we have for identifying words with similar usage or meaning and subsequently consolidating them into a single vector is through the processes of stemming and lemmatization which tend to be quite limited at consolidating words unless the two words are very close in their spelling or in their root parts-of-speech.\n","\n","### Embedding approaches preserve more textual context\n","Word2Vec is an increasingly popular word embedding technique. Like Bag-of-words it learns a real-value vector representation for a predefined fixed-size vocabulary that is generated from a corpus of text. However, in contrast to BoW, Word2Vec approaches are much more capable of accounting for textual context, and are better at discovering words with similar meanings or usages (semantic or syntactic similarity).\n","\n","##3.1 Word2Vec Intuition\n","Reference: [Deep NLP: Word Vectors with Word2Vec](https://medium.com/deep-learning-demystified/deep-nlp-word-vectors-with-word2vec-d62cb29b40b3)\n","### The Distribution Hypothesis\n","\n","In order to understand how Word2Vec preserves textual context we have to understand what's called the [Distribution Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics). The Distribution Hypothesis operates under the assumption that words that have similar contexts will have similar meanings.

Hint: Look for values that are repeated in a given column. Each column represents the context that word was found in. If there are multiple words that share a context then those words are understood to have a closer meaning with each other than with other words in the text.\n","\n","Lets look specifically at the words sunniest and rainiest. You'll notice that these two words have exactly the same 10-dimensional vector representation. Based on this very small corpora of text we would conclude that these two words have relatd meanings because they share the same usage. Is this a good assumption? Well, they are both referring to the weather outside so that's better than nothing. You could imagine that as our corpora grows larger we will be exposed a greater number of contexts and the Distribution Hypothesis assumption will improve. \n","\n","##3.2 Word2Vec Variants\n","\n","###3.2.1 Skip-Gram\n","\n","The Skip-Gram method predicts the neighbors’ of a word given a center word. In the skip-gram model, we take a center word and a window of context (neighbors) words to train the model and then predict context words out to some window size for each center word.\n","\n","This notion of “context” or “neighboring” words is best described by considering a center word and a window of words around it. \n","\n","For example, if we consider the sentence **“The speedy Porsche drove past the elegant Rolls-Royce”** and a window size of 2, we’d have the following pairs for the skip-gram model:\n","\n","**Text:**\n","**The**\tspeedy\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n","\n","*Training Sample with window of 2*: (the, speedy), (the, Porsche)\n","\n","**Text:**\n","The\t**speedy**\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n","\n","*Training Sample with window of 2*: (speedy, the), (speedy, Porsche), (speedy, drove)\n","\n","**Text:**\n","The\tspeedy\t**Porsche**\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n","\n","*Training Sample with window of 2*: (Porsche, the), (Porsche, speedy), (Porsche, drove), (Porsche, past)\n","\n","**Text:**\n","The\tspeedy\tPorsche\t**drove**\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n","\n","*Training Sample with window of 2*: (drove, speedy), (drove, Porsche), (drove, past), (drove, the)\n","\n","The **Skip-gram model** is going to output a probability distribution i.e. the probability of a word appearing in context given a center word and we are going to select the vector representation that maximizes the probability.\n","\n","With CountVectorizer and TF-IDF the best we could do for context was to look at common bi-grams and tri-grams (n-grams). Well, skip-grams go far beyond that and give our model much stronger contextual information.\n","\n","![alt text](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c7mwy6dk9k99bgh/Image%202%20-%20SkipGrams.jpg?raw=1)\n","\n","###3.2.2 Continuous Bag of Words\n","\n","This model takes thes opposite approach from the skip-gram model in that it tries to predict a center word based on the neighboring words. In the case of the CBOW model, we input the context words within the window (such as “the”, “Porsche”, “drove”) and aim to predict the target or center word “speedy” (the input to the prediction pipeline is reversed as compared to the SkipGram model).\n","\n","A graphical depiction of the input to output prediction pipeline for both variants of the Word2vec model is attached.
